Service developed to communicate with the API offered by the ciashop platform to integrate any ERP that uses relational database with the platform.

The service works with MVCS (Model, View, Controller and Service) architecture and still uses a persistence layer as vision, which can be reimplemented to work with any data architecture of other ERPs.
